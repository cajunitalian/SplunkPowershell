# SplunkPowershell

This repository is written/coded in VS 2015 IDE which explains the solution files.  It makes it easier for people to import into an IDE.

It's option BTW so feel free to do what you want with it.  The scripts/modules are still there.

Why did I write this repo?

I got frustrated with the serious lack of Splunk powershell code from their official forums and libraries.
I am hoping to rectify that with scripting and a dedicated repo.  Look for more updates in the future, for now I have only written a module and some functions out to help with install, uninstall and checks.

I plan to add more logic in soon - these were written on the fly over a 1 day periods so as I get to it, you'll see more features and additions

Thanks!
